Glue Tab Tool
=============
(AKA Ghetto Waybe)
------------------

Click on any "bounding edge" in Sketchup to add a glue tab!

What is a "bounding edge"? It's the edge of a face that does not touch any other faces. In Sketchup, "bounding edges" are the edges that are displayed in a **bold** stroke. 

It sounds complicated, but it's really quite simple: A bounding edge is the only place where it makes sense to put a glue tab on an unfolded papercraft model.

Use this script in conjunction with the [Unfold Tool](http://sketchuptips.blogspot.com/2007/08/plugin-unfoldrb.html) and you've got yourself the *ghetto manual version of [Waybe](http://waybe.weebly.com/)*, completely for free!!

Installation
============
Download `gluetab.rb` and place it in your Sketchup plugins folder. 

On a Mac, that's in `/Library/Application Support/Google SketchUp 7/SketchUp/plugins`

Usage
=====
* Select the Glue Tab tool from the Plugins menu
* Start clicking on boundary edges to make glue tabs. That's it!
